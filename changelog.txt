- Major problems with some pages of movie listings causing stalls has made me ponder rather to continue this project.
- Split TV Genres to a seperate list and have them hidden for now. (code is in Menu_BrowseByGenre for them, but page parsing not setup yet)
- Pagination.  (Setup of Next Page stuff)
- Browse List of Movies on pages. (Not all are working yet.)
- Category Menu.  Careful here, some menus will cause stalls.  (Testing done in XBMC-Gotham)
- Initial Main Menu Changes
- Initial Build (Forked from -my- solarmovie.so project)
